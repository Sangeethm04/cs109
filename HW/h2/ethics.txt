A student's adherence to academic integrity is a reflection on their
personal values. Students from a young age know how to act ethically
because it is built into them. Not following this means that you have a
lower personal care for values and are therefore of less moral standard.
If you are good in small things then you are good in big things. As a
student at Lehigh I am held to a standard of not cheating and doing the
hw on my own. This is important because it is moral and it helps you
learn the material much more than finding it elsewhere and just copying
and pasting it.
