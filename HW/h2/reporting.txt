It is important to report cases of cheating because reporting it to
someone at the end of the day teaches the student a lesson. This lesson
should help the student in the long run to learn and do work on their
own. This makes the student a better worker and more competitive in
their fields in the future. Students can report by simply private
emailing the professor so no one else knows that you are the one who
reported it.
