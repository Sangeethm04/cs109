Create a syscalls.h and syscalls.c with a minimum of wrapped functions for stat (man 2), opendir, readdir, and closedir (all man 3).

Create a cIncludesFuncs.h and cIncludesFuncs.c.

Create a cIncludes.c.

Create a makefile that has a target of "clean" and a target of "cIncludes" such that "make clean" removes all .o and the cIncludes files and "make cIncludes" compiles everything to create the cIncludes top-level executable. (You really need both cIncludesFuncs.o and cIncludes.o targets too!)

Run "bash grade.sh" to calculate your grade.
