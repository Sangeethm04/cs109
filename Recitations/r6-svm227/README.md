# r6_sp2024  Communicating Through a Pipe

Follow the directions linked on Coursesite.

Work with others! Totally fine during recitations to ask one another questions, help with debugging each other's code, etc.

After you commit everything to GitHub, clone the repo again (in a different directory from where you were working on this recitation), and run "bash ./grade.sh" again. This will be your grade.

Enjoy!
